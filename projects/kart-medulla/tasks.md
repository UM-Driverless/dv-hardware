## TODO

### Investigate routing the on-board ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 RGB LED

The DevKitC-1 has an on-board WS2812 RGB LED tied to **GPIO38** (or GPIO48 on some revisions — confirm against the exact module rev used). It is **disconnected by default**: a solder-bridge jumper on the module needs to be closed to wire the LED data line to the GPIO. If we close that bridge, that GPIO becomes unavailable for anything else on the medulla side.

**Decide:**
1. Confirm which exact GPIO the on-board LED uses on our DevKitC-1 rev (check the user-provided silkscreen / Espressif schematic for that rev).
2. Audit the current medulla schematic — is that GPIO already routed to a sensor/peripheral?
3. **If unused on our side:** leave it unwired on the medulla side AND document that closing the module's solder jumper enables the LED (→ add to `docs/`).
4. **If we're already short on pins:** skip this — the LED is a nice-to-have, not worth losing a real I/O.

Outcome to commit: a 1-line note in `docs/pinout` (or wherever pinout lives) saying "GPIO## reserved for on-board LED, leave free, requires SJ## closed on module".

### Triple-check MAX4660 (U14) throttle-mux wiring

Current verified state (per netlist generated 2026-05-07): pin 1 COM=`CMD_ACC__0_5V`, pin 2 NC=`PEDAL_ACC__0_5V`, pin 3 GND=GND, pin 4 V+=`+5V_REG`, pin 5 NC=no-connect, pin 6 IN=`SELECT_THROTTLE`, pin 7 V−=GND, pin 8 NO=`CMD_ACC_ESP32__0_5V`, pin 9 EP=GND. ERC clean.

Outstanding doubts to resolve:
- **`SELECT_THROTTLE` driver — most important.** Audit (2026-05-07) of `~/repos/kart-medulla` firmware found **no GPIO drives this line**: manual/autonomous safety is currently done by zeroing the DAC output when `mission == MISSION_MANUAL` (`main/main.c:106`). User's intent is that `SELECT_THROTTLE` should come from one of the ESP32 GPIOs OR an output of the PCF8574 GPIO expander (U25). **Action:** trace `SELECT_THROTTLE` net on the schematic — find what other pin/connector currently terminates the net. If it's a dangling stub at U23/U24 (the ESP32 header) or U25 (PCF8574), that's the intended driver and firmware needs to drive that GPIO. If it's not connected to anything at all, decide which GPIO to assign and wire it.
- **Functional cross-check vs firmware:** once a driver is assigned, verify polarity — schematic intent: LOW = COM→NC = pedal sensor pass-through (default safe state), HIGH = COM→NO = ESP32 DAC takes over. Firmware should drive LOW for manual/autonomous-disabled, HIGH for autonomous-enabled. Confirm in `main.c` once the GPIO is wired.
- **Pin 9 EP overlap (cosmetic):** earlier the `GND` text label on the EP power symbol overlapped with the chip's "EP" pin name. Resolved 2026-05-07 by moving the GND symbol up.

### Learn: how the manual `#PWR` reference rename worked

User renamed `#PWR25ce01` → `#PWR042` and `#PWRdf4d01` → `#PWR043` via KiCad GUI (right-click GND symbol → Properties → Reference field). Done; ugly auto-refs gone. **But user did not understand what was happening conceptually.** Task: read up and write a short note in `docs/` (or a comment somewhere) covering:

1. **Why every symbol has a Reference (`R12`, `U14`, `#PWR042`, etc.).** It's the unique identifier KiCad uses to map schematic symbols to PCB footprints — the netlist sends `(comp (ref "U14") ...)` and the PCB looks up `U14` to know which footprint instance gets which net. Without a unique Reference, the PCB push fails.
2. **Why power symbols (GND, +3V3, +5V_REG…) get `#PWR…` instead of `R…` or `U…`.** They are virtual-only — they exist in the schematic to declare "this wire is on the GND net" but have no physical part on the PCB. KiCad still requires every symbol to have a unique reference, so power symbols get the `#`-prefix family (`#PWR042`, `#FLG01`, `#PWR_FLAG…`) which signals "exclude from BOM, exclude from PCB push." The number is just for uniqueness; the meaning of the symbol is in its Value field (`GND`, `+3V3`).
3. **Why the auto-IDs from kicad-mcp-pro were ugly (`#PWR25ce01`).** When the MCP added a power symbol via `sch_add_power_symbol`, it generated a random suffix to avoid colliding with existing refs, but it didn't assign a clean sequential number. KiCad's Annotate tool only renames symbols whose ref ends in `?` (the "needs annotation" sentinel) — it skipped these because they had a "complete-looking" ref already.
4. **The fix the user did:** open Properties dialog (`E` key or right-click → Properties) → change the Reference text field to `#PWR042` (next free number that no other power symbol uses) → OK. Same as renaming a variable. No electrical effect — Reference is just a label.

This is worth turning into a 5-line note in `docs/kicad-conventions.md` (or wherever board-level KiCad docs live) so future board work doesn't repeat the confusion.
